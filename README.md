I was able to correctly implement the POST API and tested it with the marauder's map assignment 2.  The GET locations and redline worked as well to show the list of the list of people in the database and the up to date map of the redline.  I also implemented the index page to show the name, location and timestamp of users.

I worked with Leo Choi and Charlie Colley on this project.
